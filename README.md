# Robotic Arm for people using wheelchairs
A project for 601  
* Zheng, Yu-Jie  
* Yang, Bo-Shiang
## Product Mission
1. A robotic arm extends the user's reach and capabilities beyond the limitations of their wheelchair.
2. The robotic arm can enable wheelchair users to perform essential daily tasks independently. 
3. The goal is to recognize and match the digit pressed on the touch screen with the corresponding elevator button, initiating the elevator to the desired floor.
4. We'll simulate the scene on Gazebo
## Environments
* Camera
* Touch Screen
* Robotic Arm
* Wheelchair
## Progress for now
1. Set the Elevator Scene on Gazebo  
   (Still need to adjust the Color And Texture Models.  Resource: https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=color_model&cat= )

2. Design the robotic arm on Rviz
   * Using the urdf. file to design the model. Basically it's just a XML format.
   * I had it have color :)
